    <h1 class="itWork"><b>Cybersecurity</b></h1>
    <img src="images/cyberSecurity.png"  alt="Cybersecurity" style="width:20%">

    <h2 class="itWork">What does it do?</h2>
    <p class="itWork">
      Cybersecurity is the term used for reducing the risk of access to digital systems over the internet*.
      It involves encrypting the signals sent over the internet*, creating systems that are harder to access for unauthorised individuals*,
      as well as more difficult to automate attempts to access (cryptography). In this way, it secures data at three points - the end user's machine, the server sending the data,
      and the infrastructure that transmits it. <br>
      Cybersecurity is vital for modern infrastructure, as it prevents foreseeable attempts at compromising secure data,
      such as customer records, proprietary technology, trade secrets, and other vulnerable or personal information. <br>
      Cybersecurity assets include encryption.  <br><br>

      Cybersecurity often covers the following key areas: <br>

      The SOC (Security Operation Centre) which involves putting perimeter control processes in place to protect systems and access to the network.
      A small internal team with outsourced SOC functions will respond to breaches in security by isolating end user machines. Examples include someone who has been phished,
      where the SOC team will do diagnostics to ensure that no malicious code remains.
      <br><br>
      Data privacy policies ensure that controls, process, and other policies in place, are all made with respect to the tight control of data classification and handling,
      by putting in place a class of data and then implementing the control requirements based on the highest classification ( as an example classifications would start at highly confidential through to public)
      the higher the sensitivity the greater the control environment required.. User Access Management pertains to various clearance levels a user may have for their industry.
      For example, a computer system might have admin user versus end-level users, wherein admin has the ability to change settings that the end-user could not.
      In addition, users may have only access to data relating to their job: A risk manager would not need access to systems that had customer data, and a customer service operator would not
      need access to systems that had risk management data.
      <br><br>
      IT Governance risks and controls – using SOX (Sarbanes Oxley Act 202 section 404 requirementsiii) is an American legislature pertaining to financial reporting.
      It is being implemented here*, dealing with the accuracy and completeness of IT applications and general controls from a financial reporting perspective.
       What is paramount here is protecting whatever sensitive data (critical encryption keys, etc) may exist in the respective industries in which cybersecurity is implemented. ^
      <br><br>
      Business-facing security architects - to make sure that all new initiatives have one or more cybersecurity employees involved for consideration of cybersecurity risks.
      <br><br>
      Cybersecurity and privacy education are essential to good cybersecurity, as the human factor is one that is easily manipulated, especially in a large workforce.
      In particular, payroll employees, finance. They must ensure that cybersecurity is front-of-mind for the employees, to ensure that the organisation is making decisions that are always
      taking into consideration data loss, particularly in sensitive industries which are heavily regulated.
      <br><br>
      NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)iii is an American organisation which advises its members of frameworks that can be used to increase cybersecurity*.
      These can be helpful for completing an assessment of an organisation for identification^ of gaps in security and risks apparent. The next phase is then to protect that information
      systems and assets through examples like user access management (above) or encryption of data. Then the organisation would have a provider such as Akamaiiv or RSA who help organisations
      to manage their digital risk *^ as an example RSA have action360 as a toolv*. It looks for phishing sites, it scans social media for references to the organisation, it searches for any other
      kind of malicious sites. They would, in the detect piece, be looking at their current software, operating systems, all internal systems and determining whether there are patches that need to
      be put in place, or whether there are any zero-day vulnerabilitiesvi* Following Detect in the NIST framework is to respond, generally organisations will have a response plan, communications,
      forensics and mitigation activities. Then recover the systems to normal operations using recovery plans,
      implementation of patches and restoring affected systems.

  <h2 class="itWork">What is the likely impact?</h2>
  <p class="itWork">
    There are many examples of what happens when organisations have poor computer assets security. <br>

    Refer to historical List of Data Breaches published by Privacy Rights vii and the 15 biggest data breaches highlighted in an great infographic viii to discover the extent of issue.  <br>
    The main methods identified for data loss are due to hacking, poor security, accidental publishing, and "inside jobs", or an internal agent with malicious purposes. <br><br>

    The key impacts and outcomes for organisations are: <br>
    Significant reputational damage, due mainly to the fact that customer records are often exposed. This can be significantly more problematic depending on the industry. <br>
    Financial impacts, such as regulatory fines, customer remediation and costs related to restoring the systems, assets and implementing the effective controls. <br>
    Operational impacts, e.g. systems could be down and therefore the company may not be able to operate (e.g. Sonyix*),
    resources are diverted in order to solving the problem, or are required to invoke manual processes. <br>
    Loss of IP - significant intellectual property loss may have an adverse effect on a company as this can be used in very competitive markets
    to undercut the company's own use of their IP through illegal imitation. <br>

    Legal action by customers - class actions are commonplace today where data breaches have occurredx* due to the potential damage to the customers' own lives. <br><br>

    Identity theft -<br>
    Sony 2014xi  <br>
    Marriotxii* - Hacker group Guardians of peacexiii* released confidential data from Sony. It was believed to be a state-sponsored attack (China)*. The public release of a yet to be released film were among the threats, as well as exposure of employee personal information and salaries.
    Starwood 2018 Breach Marriot initial advised up to 5.2 million guest records were exposed, however later revised this to 383 million. It was believed to be a state-sponsored attack – (North Korea)(i).
    </p>
  <h2 class="itWork">How will this affect you?</h2>
    <p class="itWork">
      As mentioned above the key effect of poor cyber security practices can have a detrimental effect on individuals.
      Whether one is working for an organisation like Sony and one's employee information is leaked, or one is just a customer of the Marriot and your personal data,
      such as loyal card details, address, date of birth are released(ii), the results can be far reaching, up to and including impacting mental health.
      It was reported that the Ashley Maddison breachxiv* resulted in users taking their own lives as a result, breaking up seemingly happy families and costing individuals in many other ways.
      <br><br>
      Identity theft is another significant issue for individuals. Years of dealing with the resultant fall out, initially this may be just getting one's money back into bank accounts,
      having to replace personal documents such as passports or years later having to fix credit ratings due to loans being taken out under your name.
      <br><br>
      It’s important that if you are informed of a data breach effecting you that you get as much information about the lost data. What you should do:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>notify your bank </li>
          <li>change passwords </li>
          <li>monitor your accounts for unusual activity </li>
          <li>check your Credit Report  </li>
          <li>notify other identification bodies e.g. passport office. </li>
        </ul>
    <p>
      As a fun little exercise you might want to check if your own email has been compromised at “haveibeenpwned.com”xv
